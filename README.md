# ESP32-Wireless-Modules-StrainGuage-Tensor

When the patient begins to bite down in their a small amount of voltage will be released to relax the muscles so that their mouth remains open. Further testing is needed but as a result snoring can also be affected by this action.
Please note that the gauage threshold and TENS deployment high to low voltage output duration can can also be adjusted.

# Sender & Receiver
- I've supplied a script to obtain your devices' MAC address ("Mac Address Code").
- Server.ino (Sender)
MAC Address: C8:F0:9E:4E:55:B0  
0xC8, 0xF0, 0x9E, 0x4E, 0x55, 0xB0 // MAC address of server 
 
- Client.ino (Receiver)
MAC Address: EC:62:60:1D:24:88    
0xEC, 0x62, 0x60, 0x1D, 0x24, 0x88 // MAC address of client
